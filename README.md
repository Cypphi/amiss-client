# Contributing
We do not **yet** accept contributions until we have a proper client base which fits my needs.

# Why "Haze"?
_I decided to call the client "Haze" as it refers to my weed addiction and favorite type of weed: Amnesia Haze._

# Usage
_We'll not **yet** be providing any guides on how to run Haze. This is due to the fact that it's in such an early-dev stage that some builds might not even work or have any features. If you know how to run gradle projects, good for you, don't expect too much yet... Ok?_
